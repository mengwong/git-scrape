#+TITLE: HOWTO Log To Org-Mode

Programmers who like to sprinkle /printf/ statements throughout their programs should judiciously prefix output lines with hierarchical asterisks; this makes your STDERR ingestible by emacs org-mode and your logs much more accessible.

** Audience

(Systems) programmers who use Emacs and Org-Mode.

** Background

I found myself writing a simple Github scraper in Perl.

Given a username, the script first queries the Github API for the URLs of their repositories.

Then the script runs ~git clone~ for each repository.

If you're the type of programmer who has a copious "printf debugging" style, you know that this is the sort of script that could produce reams of logging output.

** How to manage the mess of logs?

Use org-mode as a logging target!

Just add asterisks, judiciously, to the start of your print output.

Tee your STDOUT/STDERR to a ~log.org~ output file.

Then open the log file in Emacs and use TAB to fold and unfold.

It's magic.

** Usage

#+begin_src text
$ git-clone username 2>&1 | tee username.org
#+end_src
